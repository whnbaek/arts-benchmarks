/**
 * @brief Creates a map function
 *
 * This function creates a GUID mapping function which is able to associate a unique GUID to an input
 * tuple. This function will reserve a range of GUIDs based on the number of GUIDs needed. GUID
 * reservation does not mean that the GUIDs are allocated in any way just that they won't be used
 * by the runtime for any other purpose.
 *

 * @param[in] numParams           Number of values in 'params'
 * @param[in] mapFunc             The mapping function. This function should be bijective
 *                                from the input tuple space to the GUID space restricted
 *                                by startGuid and skipGuid. This function takes as input, the
 *                                first GUID in the reserved range, the value of skipGuid,
 *                                user-defined parameters passed during the creation of the
 *                                map-function (a sort of memoization) and
 *                                its input tuple and outputs a GUID
 * @param[in] params              Parameters for the map function (memoized)
 * @param[in] numberGuid          Total number of GUIDs to reserve
 * @param[in] kind                Kind of the GUIDs stored in this map
