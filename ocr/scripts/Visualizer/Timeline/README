# Usage Instructions
##

This visualization tool records the timeline for thread
execution. It currently has a time.h dependency, thus
supported platforms are restricted to:
    -x86

-In ocr/build/common.mk:
    -Debug option needs to be set at DEBUG_LVL_INFO
    -DOCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING must be set.
    -DOCR_ENABLE_VISUALIZER must be set.

Script Instructions:

-Navigate to desired application directory
-Before running an application an environment variable must be set via:
    export ENABLE_VISUALIZER=yes

-*NOTE: The above env. variable will issue -DOCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING and
  -DOCR_OCR_ENABLE_VISUALIZER to the targeted app only if you are compiling
  your program with the default Makefile.  If you are using a custom Makefile,
  you must issue these compiler flags explicitely.

-Application logging output must be redirected to
 to the /ocr/scripts/Visualizer/Timeline directory
    The command would look like: make -f Makefile.x86 run > ../../scripts/Visualizer/Timeline/<log_ouput_file_name>

-Navigate to /ocr/scripts/Visualizer/Timeline, and run: python timeline.py <log_ouput_file_name> <optional flags>

    flag options:
        -s  :  Display distributed system generated EDTs (off by default)
        -c  :  Combine subsequent EDTs of equal type (off by default)
        -f  :  Force All EDTs to display on a single page (off by default)

-The output will be HTML files called timeline[*].html

-Copy html file(s) to local machine, and starting with timeline1.html, open in an internet browser.
-NOTE: The html file depends on an external JavaScript package called visJs.
